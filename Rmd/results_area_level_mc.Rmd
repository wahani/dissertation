# Robust Area Level Predictions

## Simulation Scenarios

In this section we present some results of a simulation study. To make the
results comparable to other model based simulations on area level models we
begin in this section with a simulation study on area level. Thus we can discuss
area level outliers which is what all the others do. Section? will then
introduce then a simulation study in which we start with a unit-level population
and can thus introduce both, outlying observations and areas.

To begin with we define the area level model from which we draw the data:

  $$\bar{y}_i = 100 + 1 \cdot x_i + v_i + \bar{e}_i$$

- The single regressor, $x$, is a deterministic sequence defined as $x_i = 
\frac{i}{2D} + 1$ where $D$ is the number of domains (taken from spatio temporal
FH).
- The random effect, $v$, is drawn from a normal distribution, i.e. $v_i\sim
\Distr{N}(0, \sigre)$ where $\sigre$ is defined with respect to the scenario.
- The sampling error, $e$, is drawn from $e_i\sim \Distr{N}(0, \sige)$ where
$\sige$ is an equidistant sequence from $0.8$ to $1.2$ with $D$ elements.
- General characteristics: $D = 100$ and $R = 500$ being the sumber of Monte Carlo repetitions.

To illustrate the greatness of the model we investigate two different scenarios:

1. *(0, 0)* This is the scenario where the Fay Herriot model holds. In this
scenario $\sigre = 1$.
2. *(v, 0)* This is the scenario with area level outliers. $\sigre = 1$ for 95 \%
of the areas, i.e. for $i \in \{1, \dots, 95\}$, and $\sigre = 20^2$ for $i \in
\{96, \dots, 100\}$.

Area Level Models in Small Area Estimation play an important role in the
production of reliable domain estimates.

- They can be used even if unit level observations are not accessible. 
- In a model based estimation it is largely unsolved to incorporate design
weights. Area level models can be used to start from a direct design based
estimator.
- Unit level models often have problems with heterogeneity. An assumption, for
example, for unit level data is that the error terms of a model are
homescedastic given the random effects. This assumption is often not plausible
and may call for more complex assumptions on the variance structure of the data.
However such structures may or may not be known and cannot be modelled easily.
This can also lead to computationally demanding procedures.

Given these considerations the most important factor to choose cadidate models
is the availability of data. Very often there is not much of a choice but rather
a decission given the available information. And given the availability of unit
level data, the obvious choice is to consider a model which can use such
information. Only if that fails for one of the above reasons can an area level
model be of interest.


## The Fay Herriot Model

A frequently used model in Small Area Estimation is a model introduced by
@Fay79. It starts on the area level and is used in small area estimation for
research on area-level. It is build on a sampling model:
$$
\si{\tilde{y}} = \si{\theta} + \si{e},
$$
where $\si{\tilde{y}}$ is a direct estimator of a statistic of
interest $\si{\theta}$ for an area $i$ with
$i = 1, \dots, D$ and $D$ being the number of areas. The sampling error $\si{e}$ 
is assumed to be independent and normally distributed with known variances $\sige$, i.e.
$\si{e}|\si{\theta} \sim \Distr{N}(0, \sige)$. The model is modified with the linking model by
assuming a linear relationship between the true area statistic
$\si{\theta}$ and some diterministic auxiliary variables $\si{x}$:
$$
\si{\theta} = \si{x}^\top \beta + \si{\re}
$$
Note that $\si{x}$ is a vector containing area-level (aggregated) information
for $P$ variables and $\beta$ is a vector ($1\times P$) of
regression coefficients describing the (linear) relationship. The model errors
$\re$ are assumed to be independent and normally distributed,
i.e. $\re_i \sim \Distr{N}(0, \sigre)$
furthermore $e_i$ and $\re_i$ are assumed to be
independent. Combining the sampling and linking model leads to:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:FH}
\tilde{y}_i = x_i^\top \beta + \re_i + e_i.
\end{align}


## From Unit to Area Level Models

In later simulation studies we will consider data in which area level statistics
are computed from individual information. From a contextual point of view, 
starting from individual information is advantageous in the sense that outlying 
areas can be motivated more easily. Also the question for a good estimator for 
the sampling variances can be motivated when knowing the underlying individual 
model. Hence, I will derive the Fay-Herriot model starting from unit-level. 
Consider the following model:
$$
\sij{y} = x_i^\top\beta + \re + e_i \text{ ,}
$$
where $\sij{y}$ is the response in domain $i$ of unit $j$ with $i = 1, \dots,
\si{n}$, where $\si{n}$ is the number of units in domain $i$. $\re$ is an area
specific random effect following (i.i.d.) a normal distribution with zero mean
and $\sigre$ as variance parameter. $\sij{e}$ is the remaining deviation from
the model, following (i.i.d.) a normal distribution with zero mean and $\sige$
as variance parameter. This unit level model is defined under strong
assumptions, still, assumptions most practitioner are willing to make which
could simplify the identification of the sampling variances under the area level
model.

From this model consider the area statistics $\tilde{y}_i = \frac{1}{n_j}
\sum_{j = 1}^{\si{n}}\sij{y}$, for which an area level model can be derived as:
$$
\tilde{y}_i = \si{x}^\top\beta + \si{\re} + \si{e}
$$
Considering the mean in a linear model, it can be expressed as $\bar{y} = 
\bar{x}\beta$; the random effect was defined for each area, hence it remains 
unaltered for the area level model. The error term in this model can be 
expressed as the sampling error and its standard deviation as the (conditional) 
standard deviation of the aggregated area statistic, which in this case is a 
mean. Hence, $\si{e} \sim \Distr{N}(0, \sige = \sigma^2_e / \si{n})$. Under this
unit level model a sufficient estimator for $\sige$ can be derived from
estimating $\sige$, which can be done robust and non-robust in many ways.


## Spatio-Temporal Fay Harriot model

The model stated in equation \ref{eq:FH} has been modified for including
historical information by modelling autocorrelated model errors and also by
allowing for spatial correlation (in the model error). See the discussion in
@Mar13 for more details. @Mar13 allow for both spatial and temporal correlation
in the model errors. Hence the sampling model is (simply) extended to include
historical information:
$$
y_{dt} = \mu_{dt} + e_{dt},
$$
with $d = 1, \dots, D$ and $t = 1, \dots, T$ where $D$ and $T$ are the total
number of areas and time periods respectively. Here $e_{dt} \sim \mathit{N}(0,
\sigma^2_{dt})$ are independent with known variances $\sigma_{dt}^2$. The model
error is composed of a spatial autoregressive process of order 1 (SAR(1)) and an
autoregressive process of order 1 (AR(1)):
$$
\mu_{dt} = x^\top_{dt}\beta + u_{1d} + u_{2dt},
$$
where $u_{1d}$ and $u_{2dt}$ follow a SAR(1) and AR(1) respectively:
$$
u_{1d} = \rho_1 \sum_{l\neq d}w_{d,l} u_{1l} + \epsilon_{1d},
$$
where $|\rho_1| < 1$ and $\epsilon_{1d} \sim \mathit{N}(0, \sigma_1^2)$ are
i.i.d. with $d = 1,\dots, D$. $w_{d, l}$ are the elements of $W$ which is the
row standardized proximity matrix $W^0$. The elements in $W^0$ are equal to 1 if
areas are neighboured and 0 otherwise (an area is not neighboured with itself) -
thus the dimension of $W^0$ is $D\times D$. As stated above $u_{2dt}$ follows an
AR(1):
$$
u_{2dt} = \rho_2 u_{2d, t-1} + \epsilon_{2dt},
$$
where $|\rho_2| < 1$ and $\epsilon_{2dt} \sim \mathit{N}(0, \sigma_2^2)$ are
i.i.d. with $d = 1, \dots, D$ and $t = 1, \dots, T$. Note that $u_{1d}$ and
$u_{2dt}$ and $e_{dt}$ are independent and the sampling error variance
parameters are assumed to be known. The model can then be stated as:
$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\beta + \mathbf{Z}\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{e},
$$
where $\mathbf{y}$ is the $DT\times 1$ vector containing $y_{dt}$ as elements,
$\mathbf{X}$ is the $DT \times p$ design matrix containing the vectors
$x^\top_{dt}$ as rows, $\mathbf{u}$ is the $(D + DT) \times 1$ vector of model
errors and $\mathbf{e}$ the $DT \times 1$ vector of sampling errors $e_{dt}$.
Note that $\mathbf{u} = (u_1^\top, u_2^\top)$ where the $D\times 1$ vector $u_1$
and $DT \times 1$ vector $u_2$ have $u_{1d}$ and $u_{2dt}$ as elements
respectively. Furthermore $\mathbf{Z} = (\mathbf{Z}_1, \mathbf{Z}_2)$ has
dimension $DT \times (D+DT)$, where $\mathbf{Z}_1 = \mathbf{I}_D \otimes
\mathbf{1}_T$ ($\mathbf{I}_D$ denotes a $D\times D$ identity matrix and
$\mathbf{1}_T$ a $1 \times T$ vector of ones) has dimension $DT \times D$ and
$\mathbf{Z}_2$ is a $DT \times DT$ identity matrix.

Concerning the variance of $\mathbf{y}$ first consider the distributions of all
error components. $\mathbf{e} \sim \mathit{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{V}_e)$ where
$\mathbf{V}_e$ is a diagonal matrix with the known $\sigma^2_{dt}$ on the main
diagonal. $\mathbf{u} \sim \mathit{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{V}_u(\theta))$ with
the block diagonal covariance matrix $\mathbf{V}_u(\theta) =
\text{diag}(\sigma_1^2\Omega_1(\rho_1), \sigma_2^2\Omega_2(\rho_2))$ where
$\theta = (\sigma_1^2, \rho_1, \sigma_2^2, \rho_2)$.

$$
\Omega_1(\rho_1) = \left((\mathbf{I}_D - \rho_1\mathbf{W})^\top (\mathbf{I}_D - \rho_1\mathbf{W})\right)^{-1}
$$
and follows from the SAR(1) process in the model errors. $\Omega_2(\rho_2)$ has
a block diagonal structure with $\Omega_{2d}(\rho_2)$ denoting the blocks where
the definition of $\Omega_{2d}(\rho_2)$ follows from the AR(1) process:
  $$
    \Omega_{2d}(\rho_2) = \frac{1}{1-\rho_2^2}
    \left(
      \begin{matrix}
      1 & \rho_2 & \cdots & \rho_2^{T-2}& \rho_2^{T-1}\\
      \rho_2 & 1 & & & \rho_2^{T-2} \\
      \vdots & & \ddots & & \vdots \\
      \rho_2^{T-2} &&& 1 & \rho_2 \\
      \rho_2^{T-1} & \rho_2^{T-2} & \cdots & \rho_2 & 1\\
      \end{matrix}
      \right)_{T\times T}
  $$
The variance of $\mathbf{y}$ can thus be stated as:
$$
\mathbb{V}(\mathbf{y}) = \mathbf{V}(\theta) = \mathbf{Z}\mathbf{V}_u(\theta)\mathbf{Z}^\top + \mathbf{V}_e
$$
The BLUE of $\beta$ and BLUP of $\theta$ can be stated as \citep[see][]{Hen75}:
$$
\tilde{\beta}(\theta) = \left(\mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{V}^{-1}(\theta) \mathbf{X} \right)^{-1} \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{V}^{-1}(\theta) \mathbf{y}
$$
$$
\tilde{u}(\theta) = \mathbf{V}_u(\theta) \mathbf{Z}^\top \mathbf{V}^{-1}(\theta) \left(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\tilde{\beta}(\theta)\right)
$$
Hence the BLUP of $u_1$ and $u_2$ can be stated as:
$$
\tilde{u}_1(\theta) = \sigma_1^2 \Omega_1(\rho_1) \mathbf{Z}^\top \mathbf{V}^{-1}(\theta) \left(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\tilde{\beta}(\theta)\right)
$$
$$
\tilde{u}_2(\theta) = \sigma_2^2 \Omega_2(\rho_2) \mathbf{Z}^\top \mathbf{V}^{-1}(\theta) \left(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\tilde{\beta}(\theta)\right)
$$
Estimating $\theta$ leads to the EBLUE for $\beta$ and EBLUPs for $u_1$ and
$u_2$, hence an predictor for the area characteristic $\mu_{dt}$ is given by:
$$
\hat{\mu}_{dt} = x_{dt}^\top \hat{\beta} + \hat{u}_{1d} + \hat{u}_{2dt}
$$
@Mar13 use a restricted maximum likelihood method to estimate $\theta$
  independently of $\beta$. An open question is if this approach can be applied
  for the robust spatio-temporal model. Thus we will continue with the
  discussion of robust small area methods.

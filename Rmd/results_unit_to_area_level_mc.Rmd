In this section we want to present a different perspective for simulation
studies on area level models. Namely by starting from the unit level population
data. This allows for a number of interesting aspects which can be investigated
and explained:

- Under the Fay Herriot model we specify an area level model with
heteroscedastic sampling distribution. The model does not explain what the
source of heteroscedasticity is. We induce two different sources, one is the
sampling size varying accros domains, and the other one are unit level outliers.
- When we begin from the unit level we may ask what the true sampling variance
is; which is assumed to be known under the model. In practice it is an estimated
quantity which itself, like a direct estimator of the mean, is unreliable. So it
will be relevant to discuss how the Fay Herriot estimator is performing when the
direct variance estimator is an additional source of uncertainty. Recent
research suggests that smoothed variances should be plugged into the FH
estimator. In contrast to this discussion we will argue that direct variance
estimators are a viable source of information when unit level outliers are an
issue.
- In the context of unit level outliers it can be intuitive to suggest a robust
direct estimator instead of the sample mean. Hence we compare how the use of a
median and a huber type estimator of the mean compete against the sampling mean.

In general our simulation setup borrows from unit level scenarios from the literature to make this exercise as convenient as possible. The basis is again a linear mixed model, this time defined on the unit population level:

  $$\sij{y} = 100 + 1 \cdot \si{x} + v_i + \sij{e}$$

- The regressor, $x_i$, and random effect, $v_i$, are defined in the same way as
for the area level scenario.
- The error term, $\sij{e}$, is defined as $\sij{e} \sim \Distr{N}(0, 
\sigma_e^2)$ where $\sigma_e^2$ is varies across simulation scenarios.
- From this populatin model we draw samples with simple random sampling without
replacement. The sample sizes are $n_i \in \{5, \dots, 15\}$ and $N_i = 1000$;
$D$ is again 100.
- The sample is then aggregated using different direct estimators. The sample
mean, the sample median and a robust direct estimator (huber m-type). Note that
$x_i$ is constant within domains. For the variance estimation we use the sample
variance, a generalized variance function which can be considered optimal under
the population model and the median absolute deviance from the median within
domains.
- On area level the standard Fay Herriot model is used with different variance
estimators and corresponding direct estimators and compared with the RFH.

With these settings we are interested in several different choices varying
across simulation scenarios. We want to emphasise how unit and area level
outliers can influence area level predictions.

1. *(0, 0)* This is the scenario in which the area level model as described in 
section? holds, i.e. there are no outliers. Here $\sigma_e^2 = 4^2$ and $\sigre =
1$ for all domains. However, the sampling variances ($\sige =
\frac{\sigma_e^2}{n_i}$) derived under the unit level population model range
from 1 to 3.2 for their respective sample size. $\sigre = 1$.
2. *(v, 0)* This scenario is close to the area level data generation in the 
previous section where we induced area level outliers. For that purpose we 
choose $\sigre = 1$ for the areas where $i \in \{1, \dots, 95\}$ and $\sigre = 
20^2$ for $i \in \{96, \dots, 100\}$
3. *(0, e)* In this scenario unit level outliers do exist. To make the magnitude
comparable to simulation studies in the literature we choose $\sigma_e^2 = 
150^2$ for $i \in \{90, \dots, 95\}$.
4. *(v, e)* This scenario is the combination of 2 and 3 where we have area level
and unit level outliers, however not in the same domains.

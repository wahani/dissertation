# From Unit to Area Level Contamination

In this section a different perspective is taken in that a model\hyp{}based
simulation study is conducted beginning from a unit level population. This is an
approach taken typical for unit level models; see for example @Cha14 and @Sin09.
However results for robust area level models are often produced using area level
data -- see for example @Fab10 -- or studied using survey data -- see for 
example @Bel06 and @Xie07. This area level perspective implicitly rules out any
impact of unit level outliers on area level models; and whether such
observations can influence predictions is subject of this Section.

This change in perspective enables a more thorough investigation of the impact
of unit level contamination when applying area level models. Furthermore it must
be stated how we estimate the sampling variance of the direct estimator which
can have an impact as well; these quantities have been assumed to be known so
far. In the literature the estimation of the sampling variances is often 
connected to the application of smoothing techniques -- see Section (?) for a 
review -- to stabilise these parameters. Hence in this context several points
motivate this study:

- Under the FH model we specify an area level model with a heteroscedastic
sampling distribution. The model does not explain the source for this
heteroscedasticity. In the following two different sources are induced: one is
the sampling size varying across domains, and the other one are unit level
outliers.
- When we begin from the unit level we may ask what the true sampling variance 
is; this quantity is assumed to be known under the model. In practice these
values are estimated and are themselves unreliable if the target is the
population variance. So it will be relevant to discuss how the FH estimator and
the robust extension perform when the direct variance estimator is an additional
source of uncertainty. Also it is unclear how smoothing techniques relate to
unit level outliers.
- In the context of unit level outliers it can be intuitive to suggest a robust 
direct estimator instead of the sample mean. Hence different robust direct
estimators are used as an alternative to the domain specific sample mean.

This discussion is of practical relevance but is conceptually unrelated to
the question if we exploit spatial and temporal correlation structures in the 
data. For this reason the following study has a focus on the FH model and 
excludes the spatial and temporal extensions. In principle these results should 
apply to these extensions also; however this remains an avenue for further
research.

This simulation study is structured as follows: the following Section 
\ref{sec:results_unit_level_model} completes the formal link between the unit 
and area level. Essentially we need to specify assumptions with respect to the 
unit level population model to have a coherent link between the population 
level, the sampled level, and the area level. Based on these results Section
\ref{sec:results_unit_sim_setting} presents the simulation settings; Section
\ref{sec:results_unit_measures} the investigated estimation strategies; and in
Section \ref{sec:results_unit_results} the results of the Monte Carlo Simulation
are presented.


## A Unit Level Population Model
\label{sec:results_unit_level_model}

In the following a similar unit level model to the model in Section (?) is
considered. In contrast here we do not need the distinction between sampled and
non\hyp{}sampled units to adress the points motivating this study. Hence we begin with a liner mixed model

In later simulation studies we will consider data in which area level statistics
are computed from individual information. From a contextual point of view, 
starting from individual information is advantageous in the sense that outlying 
areas can be motivated more easily. Also the question for a good estimator for 
the sampling variances can be motivated when knowing the underlying individual 
model. Hence, I will derive the Fay-Herriot model starting from unit-level. 
Consider the following model:
$$
\sij{y} = x_i^\top\beta + \re + e_i \text{ ,}
$$
where $\sij{y}$ is the response in domain $i$ of unit $j$ with $i = 1, \dots,
\si{n}$, where $\si{n}$ is the number of units in domain $i$. $\re$ is an area
specific random effect following (i.i.d.) a normal distribution with zero mean
and $\sigre$ as variance parameter. $\sij{e}$ is the remaining deviation from
the model, following (i.i.d.) a normal distribution with zero mean and $\sige$
as variance parameter. This unit level model is defined under strong
assumptions, still, assumptions most practitioner are willing to make which
could simplify the identification of the sampling variances under the area level
model.

From this model consider the area statistics $\tilde{y}_i = \frac{1}{n_j}
\sum_{j = 1}^{\si{n}}\sij{y}$, for which an area level model can be derived as:
$$
\tilde{y}_i = \si{x}^\top\beta + \si{\re} + \si{e}
$$
Considering the mean in a linear model, it can be expressed as $\bar{y} = 
\bar{x}\beta$; the random effect was defined for each area, hence it remains 
unaltered for the area level model. The error term in this model can be 
expressed as the sampling error and its standard deviation as the (conditional) 
standard deviation of the aggregated area statistic, which in this case is a 
mean. Hence, $\si{e} \sim \Distr{N}(0, \sige = \sigma^2_e / \si{n})$. Under this
unit level model a sufficient estimator for $\sige$ can be derived from
estimating $\sige$, which can be done robust and non-robust in many ways.

## Simulation Scenarios
\label{sec:results_unit_sim_setting}

In general our simulation setup borrows from unit level scenarios from the literature to make this exercise as convenient as possible. The basis is again a linear mixed model, this time defined on the unit population level:

  $$\sij{y} = 100 + 1 \cdot \si{x} + v_i + \sij{e}$$

- The regressor, $x_i$, and random effect, $v_i$, are defined in the same way as
for the area level scenario.
- The error term, $\sij{e}$, is defined as $\sij{e} \sim \Distr{N}(0, 
\sigma_e^2)$ where $\sigma_e^2$ is varies across simulation scenarios.
- From this populatin model we draw samples with simple random sampling without
replacement. The sample sizes are $n_i \in \{5, \dots, 15\}$ and $N_i = 1000$;
$D$ is again 100.
- The sample is then aggregated using different direct estimators. The sample
mean, the sample median and a robust direct estimator (huber m-type). Note that
$x_i$ is constant within domains. For the variance estimation we use the sample
variance, a generalized variance function which can be considered optimal under
the population model and the median absolute deviance from the median within
domains.
- On area level the standard Fay Herriot model is used with different variance
estimators and corresponding direct estimators and compared with the RFH.

With these settings we are interested in several different choices varying
across simulation scenarios. We want to emphasise how unit and area level
outliers can influence area level predictions.

1. *(0, 0)* This is the scenario in which the area level model as described in 
section? holds, i.e. there are no outliers. Here $\sigma_e^2 = 4^2$ and $\sigre =
1$ for all domains. However, the sampling variances ($\sige =
\frac{\sigma_e^2}{n_i}$) derived under the unit level population model range
from 1 to 3.2 for their respective sample size. $\sigre = 1$.
2. *(v, 0)* This scenario is close to the area level data generation in the 
previous section where we induced area level outliers. For that purpose we 
choose $\sigre = 1$ for the areas where $i \in \{1, \dots, 95\}$ and $\sigre = 
20^2$ for $i \in \{96, \dots, 100\}$
3. *(0, e)* In this scenario unit level outliers do exist. To make the magnitude
comparable to simulation studies in the literature we choose $\sigma_e^2 = 
150^2$ for $i \in \{90, \dots, 95\}$.
4. *(v, e)* This scenario is the combination of 2 and 3 where we have area level
and unit level outliers, however not in the same domains.

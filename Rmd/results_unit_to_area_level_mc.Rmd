# From Unit to Area Level Contamination
\label{sec:results_unit}

In this section a different perspective is taken in that a model\hyp{}based
simulation study is conducted beginning from a unit level population. This is an
approach taken typical for unit level models; see for example @Cha14 and @Sin09.
However results for robust area level models are often produced using area level
data -- see for example @Fab10 -- or studied using survey data -- see for 
example @Bel06 and @Xie07. This area level perspective implicitly rules out any
impact of unit level outliers on area level models; and whether such
observations can influence predictions is subject of this Section.

This change in perspective enables a more thorough investigation of the impact
of unit level contamination when applying area level models. Furthermore it must
be stated how we estimate the sampling variance of the direct estimator which
can have an impact as well; these quantities have been assumed to be known so
far. In the literature the estimation of the sampling variances is often 
connected to the application of smoothing techniques -- see Section (?) for a 
review -- to stabilise these parameters. Hence in this context several points
motivate this study:

- Under the FH model we specify an area level model with a heteroscedastic
sampling distribution. The model does not explain the source for this
heteroscedasticity. In the following two different sources are induced: one is
the sample size varying across domains, and the other one are unit level
outliers.
- When we begin from the unit level we may ask what the true sampling variance 
is; this quantity is assumed to be known under the model. In practice these
values are estimated and are themselves unreliable if the target is the
population variance. So it will be relevant to discuss how the FH estimator and
the robust extension perform when the direct variance estimator is an additional
source of uncertainty. Also it is unclear how smoothing techniques relate to
unit level outliers.
- In the context of unit level outliers it can be intuitive to suggest a robust 
direct estimator instead of the sample mean. Hence different robust direct
estimators are used as an alternative to the domain specific sample mean.

This discussion is of practical relevance but is conceptually unrelated to
the question if we exploit spatial and temporal correlation structures in the 
data. For this reason the following study has a focus on the FH model and 
excludes the spatial and temporal extensions. In principle these results should 
apply to these extensions also; however this remains an avenue for further
research.

This simulation study is structured as follows: the following Section 
\ref{sec:results_unit_level_model} completes the formal link between the unit 
and area level. Essentially we need to specify assumptions with respect to the 
unit level population model to have a coherent link between the population 
level, the sampled level, and the area level. Based on these results Section
\ref{sec:results_unit_sim_setting} presents the simulation settings; Section
\ref{sec:results_unit_measures} the investigated estimation strategies; and in
Section \ref{sec:results_unit_results} the results of the Monte Carlo Simulation
are presented.


## A Unit Level Population Model
\label{sec:results_unit_level_model}

In the following the unit level population model assumed for this study is 
presented. In contrast to the BHF model reviewed in Section (?) here we do not
need the distinction between sampled and non\hyp{}sampled units. Hence we begin
with a liner mixed model for the population of the form:
$$
y_{ij} = x_i^\top \beta + \re_i + e_{ij}
$$
with $i = 1, \dots, D$ and $j = 1, \dots, N_i$. Here $x_i$ is a vector of 
auxiliary information and $\beta$ the vector of regression coefficients; $\re_i$
is a i.i.d. random variable: $\re_i \sim \Distr{N}(0, \sigre)$; and 
$e_{ij}$ is also a i.i.d. random variable: $e_{ij} \sim \Distr{N}(0, 
\sigma_e^2)$. Given this simple unit level model consider the case in which we
draw samples with simple random sampling without replacement (SRSWOR) in each
domain. Here we only consider the case where units are observed for all domains.
The domain specific sample sizes are denoted by $n_i$. When we use the sample
mean as a direct estimator we can derive the area level model as:
$$
\bar{y}_i = \underbrace{x_i^\top \beta + \re_i}_{\theta_i} + \bar{e}_i
$$
with $i = 1, \dots, D$. Here $\bar{y}_i$ denotes the direct estimator and
$\theta_i$ the true target statistic. The sampling errors, $\bar{e}_i$, are
i.i.d. with $\bar{e}_i \sim \Distr{N}(0, \sige)$ where $\sige =
\frac{\sigma_e^2}{n_i}$. In this simple setting $x_i$ and $\re_i$ are the same
for the unit and area level since they are constant within domains. Also we see
in the definition of $\sige$ that the only source for the heteroscedasticity are
the sample sizes, $n_i$. An additional source for heteroscedastic sample errors may also be induced by unit level outliers. 

## Simulation Scenarios
\label{sec:results_unit_sim_setting}

The model underlying the Monte Carlo study is given by:
$$y_{ij} = 100 + 5 x_i + \re_i + e_{ij}$$

- The regressor, $x_i$, is a deterministic sequence defined as in the 
model\hyp{}based scenarios before: $x_i = \frac{i}{2D} + 1$
- From this model a population is generated in each Monte Carlo repetition. Each
domain is of size $N_i = 1000$ and we consider $D = 40$ as before.
- Samples are drawn with SRSWOR in each domain. The sample sizes are defined as 
$n_i \in \{5, \dots, 15\}$. They are sorted as ascending sequence in $i$. The 
sample sizes are chosen in corespondence to the variance of the unit error in
the non\hyp{}outlier scenario such that the sampling variances of the sample
means are an ascending sequence between 2 and 6.

With these settings several different choices for outlier contamination are
investigated. Here we can now consider unit and area level outliers:

- *(0, 0)* -- no contamination. Here $\re_i \sim \Distr{N}(0, 4)$ and
$e_{ij} \sim \Distr{N}(0, 32)$.
- *(u, 0)* -- area level outliers. Similar to the generation before the 
non\hyp{}contaminated domains are generated from $\re_i \sim \Distr{N}(0, 4)$
and $e_{ij} \sim \Distr{N}(0, 32)$. Outlying domains are domains with $i \in
\{5, 15, 25, 35\}$ and their respective random effect is given by $\re_i \sim
\Distr{N}(9, 25)$.
- *(0, e)* -- unit level outliers. The random effect is drawn from $\re_i \sim 
\Distr{N}(0, 4)$. Individual outliers are generated from a mixtrue of two 
independent normals: $e_{ij} \sim \delta_i \Distr{N}(0, 32) + (1 - \delta_i) 
\Distr{N}(20, 200)$ where $\delta$ is a Bernoulli random variable with 
$\Exp{P}(\delta = 1) = 0.8$ for domains with $i \in \{4, 14, 24, 34\}$ and set
to one otherwise. I.e. 10 per cent of the areas have 20 per cent of unit level 
observations which are generated from the outlier distribution. 
- *(0, e-sym)* -- symmetric unit level outliers. This scenario is the same as
*(0, e)* with the unit level outlier distribution replaced by $\Distr{N}(0,
200)$. Hence symmetric unit level outliers are imposed.
- *(u, e)* -- unit and area level outliers. The area level contamination is
imposed as in *(u, 0)* and the unit level contamination as in *(0, e)*.


## Quality Measures and Considered Methods
\label{sec:results_unit_measures}

Two measure are utilised to asses the quality of predictions: the Monte Carlo
RRMSPE and Monte Carlo RBIAS. These quantities are computed according to Section
(?). The performence is studied for several methods; the non\hyp{}robust
predictions under the FH model and robust predection refered to as RFH. The
following modelling strategies are considered:

- SM -- denotes the sample mean. Since we sample with SRSWOR an unbiased direct
estimator is the sample mean.
- RM -- denotes a robust direct estimator. Here the sample median is used.
- FH.SM -- is the non\hyp{}robust prediction under the FH model. This model is
based on the sample mean and uses the direct variance estimate as sampling
variance for each domain: $\sige \coloneqq \frac{s_i^2}{n_i}$.
- RFH.SM -- is the robust prediction based the sample mean. The same setup is
used as for FH.SM.
- FH.SM.GVF -- is the non\hyp{}robust prediction under the FH model using a 
generilsed variance function. In contrast to FH.SM a generalised variance 
function is used as an estimator for the sampling variance: $\sige \coloneqq 
\frac{\tilde{s}^2}{n_i}$ with
$$
\tilde{s}^2 = \frac{1}{n - D} \sum_{i = 1}^D (n_i - 1) s_i^2
$$
where $s^2_i$ denotes the sample variance for domain $i$.
- RFH.SM.GVF -- is the robust prediction using the generilsed variance function.
This has the same setup as the FH.SM.GVF using the robust prediction.
- RFH.SM.BC -- is the robust prediction with the sample mean as direct estimator
and direct variance estimates. The predictions are bias corrected as described
in Section (?).
- FH.RM -- is the non\hyp{}robust prediction based on the sample median. As 
sampling variance a robust estimator is used based on the median absolute
deviation (MAD): $\sige \coloneqq \frac{\text{MAD}_i^2}{n_i}$.
- RFH.RM -- is the robust prediction based on the sample median. The sampling
variances are estimated as for the FH.RM method.


## Results
\label{sec:results_unit_results}

To summarise the results of this study consider Figure \ref{fig:unit_mse} and
\ref{fig:unit_bias}. With these results the following observations can be made:

- There is only a small advantage of using genaralised variance functions as an
alternative to direct variance estimates.
- The robust FH prediction has no additional effect under unit level outliers.
- A robust direct estimator has no advantage over the sample mean.

\end{figure}

The first observation I want to point out is, that the particular choice for the
generalised variance function (GVF) does not show a convenient gain in 
performance. @Wol07[272-273] points out that the main benefits for using GVFs
may be to reduce the computational demand, to ease the communication of results,
and a gain in stability. He argues that we can expect a gain in stability since 
instead of many parameters -- one for each domain -- fewer and hence more stable
parameters can to be estimated. However he also notes that there is no theory 
supporting this claim. The discussion in Section (?) showed that despite this 
lack of theory the use of generalised variance functions is often preferred in 
practical applications.  Hence it may well be that we observe results specific 
to this simulation setting.

Some differences when using GVFs can be observed with respect to the RBIAS. In a
scenario with non\hyp{}symmetric unit level outliers we can see an increase in 
terms of bias. What here happens is that the overall variance is smoothed. Hence
smaller sampling variances, $\sige$, are assigned to the the outlying domains 
making them to appear to be more reliable measurements. This results in a 
stronger impact of outlying domains on the predictions and thus an increase in 
bias. In Section (?) this effect was labeled as the *creation of overly
influencial observations*.

In the simulation scenario here considered the unit level outlier contamination
does not influence the estimation of the GVF. In a different setting with a
stronger contamination the GVF can be expected to overstimate the true sampling
variances. In preliminary experiments this lead to a loss in efficiency in terms
of RRMSPE.

The second observation is that the robust prediction under a FH model does not
improve the predictions under unit level contamination. The results under
symmetric unit level contamination show that the FH model has a self adjusting
effect as it was described in Section (?). The prediction mechanism under the FH
model gives more weight to the linear predictor for the outlying domains since
we observe a large sampling variance for these type of outliers. This is a
desiarable property as long as the linear prediction is a good fit for these 
observations. When we compare these results with the non\hyp{}symmetric outlier 
scenario -- *(0, e)* -- we can see that the effect of unit level contamination 
on the prediction is small overall. This is so for all modelling strategies 
except when using GVFs for the reasons outlined above. However in these
situations we introduce a bias for the outlying domains. In contrast to the bias
correction for unit level models -- see Section (?) for a review -- such a bias
cannot be corrected using area level data.

The use of the RFH model is limited when we consider unit level contamination.
The self adjusting effect of the FH model is in general also present in the
robust prediction. When we consider the use of the GVF it can happen with more
extreme outlier contamination that the RFH model is preferable. This is so
because we create overly influencial observations which from their design do not
differ from area level outlier; at least from the area level perspective.

The third observation is that a robust direct estimator, here the median, has no
additional advantage over the sample mean. Here several points need to be 
mentioned. First, using a robust estimator may be problematic when we consider 
small samples in that the median will have itself an even higher variance than 
the sample mean. The additional gain -- at least in the considered scenarios -- 
with respect to unit level contamination does not seem to outweigh this. This is
also true when we consider the same symmetric unit level outlier setting in all 
instead of only a small number of domains. Second, the variance estimation of a 
robust direct method is problematic, again, because we consider small samples. 
In practice it may be desiarable to use a bootstrap for estimating the variance 
of the sample median. With these small samples the results have been 
discouraging have not lead to an improvement for the area level predictions. 
Hence the MAD seemed to provide a sensible alternative. Third, it may be argued
that a different robust method should be considered. In a simulation a M-type 
estimator for the sample mean in conjunction with a robust variance estimator
has been considered. Very similar results as we can observe for the median have
been observed since these results have been omitted.


## Discussion

There are two main reasons to consider a robust area level model. First to make
the prediction robust against area level outliers. Second to protect against the
creation of overly influencial observations as they can occure after using GVFs
to smooth the sampling variances. However a more thorough investigation of the
use of GVFs may be necessary to come to a recommendation since the simulation
setup has not shown a significant improvement of the overall predictions.

With respect to unit level outliers we can see a self adjusting effect of the 
robust and non\hyp{}robust prediction under the FH model. This adjustment 
replaces the predictions for outliers with the linear predictor which is an 
improvement in cases in which this predictor is suitable, e.g. unbiased. In 
principle we face the same problem as for robust methods using unit level data
in that we introduce a bias. However at present it is unclear as to how a bias
correction can be developed for these situations when only area level data is
observed. The proposed bias correction can have a beneficial effect when we
consider area level contamination however it does not provide any advantage with
respect to unit level outliers.

The use of robust direct estimators has not been encouraging. It may be that to 
try to solve an efficiency problem of the sample mean by replacing it with an
even less efficient estimator is the main reason here. This effect can well be 
due to the small sample sizes considered in SAE but specifically in this 
simulation setup. These small sample sizes then lead to an less efficient 
estimate for the domain mean and also its variance. Using an area level model
has not showed to outweigh this effect here.

# Theory

In Chapter \ref{chap:review} relevant advances in the SAE field have been
reviewed. Two developments are central for the content of this Thesis: First the
extension of the FH model by incorporating spatial and temporal correlation
structures into the random effects part of the model. Second by reviewing the
current state of robust estimation methodology within the field. Here the
presentation focused on the results for the robust estimation of model
parameters when we consider models framed as linear mixed models.

In particular the spatial extension of the FH model by @Pra08 is of interest.
Here the random effects part of the model is assumed to follow a simultaneous
autoregressive process (SAR) of order one. Under this model @Pra08 derived a
spatial EBLUP (SEBLUP) which they applied on the survey on Life Conditions in
Tuscany, Italy. They aimed at predicting the mean per capita income within
municipalities. Furthermore they found that incorporating the unobserved spatial
correlation between domains -- the SAR process -- into the prediction lead to an
improvement in terms of MSPE; here however measured in terms of the domain
specific coefficient of variation.

The reviewed temporal extension by @Rao94 follows the idea to split the random 
effects into a random intercept and autocorrelated process (AR) of order one. 
The underlying data now has repeated measurements for each domain. The variation
within domains and hence between the repeated measurements is addressed using the
AR(1) process; the between domain variation is captured by having an additional 
random intercept. In this context they introduced a temporal EBLUP (TEBLUP).
Empirical results are here based on a model based simulation study. Later @Sin05
showed the advantage of incorporating temporal autocorrelation into the analysis
where they predict the per capita consumption expenditure using an annual
consumer survey in India.

The combination of these methods was then introduced by @Mar13; they replaced 
the random intercept in the temporal model of @Rao94 with a SAR(1) process. 
Using this model they derive a spatio\hyp{}temporal EBLUP (STEBLUP). They 
evaluate their method using the Survey on Income and Living Conditions for Spain
and predict two poverty indicators. They show results for the spatial, temporal,
and their spatio-temporal extension to the FH model. Their results suggest that 
especially the incorporation of the correlation over time presents a beneficial
effect.

Next to the different possibilities to incorporate correlated random effects in
Section \ref{sec:saerobust} recent advances for outlier robust predictions in
the SAE field have been reviewed. The robust methodology used in this Thesis are
based on the results of @Sin09 and @Ric95. Here the idea is to *robustify* the 
score functions of the maximum likelihood function for a given mixed linear 
model. Based on these robust estimation equations the model parameters and 
domain predictions can be derived. To this extend the residuals in the score 
function are bounded using an appropriate influence function. In various model 
and design based simulation studies the advantage of such methods have been 
demonstrated when outliers are present in the data; see for example @Sin09,
@Cha14, @Sch14, and @Sch16.

The main contribution of this Thesis is now the combination of the robust 
estimation methodology with the spatial and temporal extensions to the FH model.
This connection is established in Chapter \ref{chap:rfh}. Here I distinguished
between three types of outlying observations: unit level outliers, area level
outliers, and overly influential observations. The first two types are common in
the robust literature and describe outlying units and outlying areas
respectively. The third type may be artificial in the context of area level
models: they may present a problem when we smooth direct variance estimators. By
doing this we may create observations which appear to be reliable but are in
fact heavily influenced by unit level outliers. Especially with respect to area 
level outliers and overly influential observations the robust extension to the
spatial and temporal FH models may present itself to be beneficial.

With regard to robust area level models four models have been under 
consideration. The *standard* FH model, the spatial extension by @Pra08, the 
temporal extension by @Rao94, and the combination in the spatio\hyp{}temporal 
model by @Mar13. The results are here an area level robust EBLUP (REBLUP) which 
is the direct result of applying the results of @Sin09; an area level spatial
REBLUP (SREBLUP) which, to contrast it from @Sch11, is based on the FH model
instead of the BHF model; the temporal REBLUP (TREBLUP); and the
spatio\hyp{}temporal REBLUP (STREBLUP). Essentially these models are presented
in a comprehensive framework for robust area level models where some additional
changes have been made in contrast to the results of @Sin09:

- The robust score functions have been changed such that they can be used in the
context of correlated random effects.
- The robust score functions have been combined with the results by @Cha11 and
@Cha14 to derive the area level REBLUPs -- the area level SREBLUP, TREBLUP, and 
  STREBLUP -- in a pseudo linear form. The results are presented in general
  notation to include the general class of mixed linear models.
- This pseudolinear representation has lead to an IRWLS algorithm for the 
regression coefficients. Furthermore an algorithm for the optimisation of the 
random effects has been proposed which is also derived from the pseudolinear
form. Both solutions may have the advantage that they reduce to the non robust
BLUE estimator and EBLUP for the random effects when the influence function is
the identity.
- Solutions for the variance parameters of the different models are sought for
using a fixed point algorithm based on the results by @Chat12. The solutions for
these parameters need to be tuned for each model.
- Furthermore a simple bias correction for the robust prediction has been 
adapted based on the results of @Efr72. This bias correction is simply the
*limeted translation estimator* proposed by @Efr72 and may be useful when we
suspect asymmetric area level outliers.
- And finally the approach by @Cha11 to the estimation of the MSPE of domain 
predictions has been extended to be used with the area level models with 
correlated random effects. The robust extension is here simply a special case
defined by its pseudolinear representation. In this regard also the parametric 
bootstrap method for the MSPE estimation by @Sin09 has been adapted. These
results have been directly applicable without further change as they are
formulated for the general case of linear mixed model.

These results may not only be useful for the specific models under consideration
but present a generic framework for robust area level models which are based on
the class of linear mixed models. 


# Implementation

Two results of this Thesis are also the software implementations in the 
`R`\hyp{}language \citep{R}. `saeRobust` \citep{War16} provides an
implementation of the area level REBLUP, SREBLUP, TREBLUP, and STREBLUP.
Additionally to the predictions for each model three types of diagnostic plots
are provided: normal Quantile\hyp{}Quantile plots for the random effects and
model residuals; mean\hyp{}difference plots for the predictions; and diagnostic
plots for the estimated MSPE. Additionally predictions can be made using the
proposed bias correction and for both versions of predictions the
pseudolinearisation based MSPE estimator and the parametric bootstrap are
implemented.

Chapter \ref{chap:saeRobust} reviews the main features of this software
implementation. In addition the stability of the algorithms is investigated. To
this extend a model based simulation study is conducted where the data is
generated to represent a numerically challenging situation. This is accomplished
by inducing deterministic outliers of relatively large magnitude and by using bad
starting values.

In principle the results of the stability tests are promising as in all
scenarios acceptable solutions can be found when we set the number of iterations
to a higher value. *Acceptable* here refers to a value close to zero at the
solution for the respective estimation equation. This however presents a trade 
off between the number of iterations, stability, and computational demand, which
can become relevant quickly with temporal data. The key to computationally less 
demanding solutions are the choice of starting values or generally an algorithm
which proves to have a higher convergence rate.

In addition to the package `saeRobust` also a software package for implementing 
model and design based simulation studies in the context of the SAE field is 
provided: `saeSim` \citep{War15}. This package has already been introduced in
@War16a and Chapter \ref{chap:saeSim} is an adaptation of this article to
  present this package within the context of this Thesis.

The main *design* aspect making `saeSim` a useful tool is that simulations can 
be composed by combining different components. Furthermore it may promote a 
reasonable way for the definition of such components within the `R`-language: as
short, single argument functions which take a `data.frame` as input and return 
it modified. In this regard one goal of this implementation is to propose a
reasonable way of conducting simulation studies in the `R`-language. This may
contributing towards the reproducibility and of such results within the field
since source code is easier to share and tools are tested to be correct.


# Results

Empirical results can be found in model based simulations in Chapter 
\ref{chap:results_model_based} and a design based simulation study in Chapter 
\ref{chap:results_design_based}. The aim of the model based simulation studies
has not been to investigate the beneficial effect of correlated random effects
on domain predictions. Instead these studies show how the robust and
non\hyp{}robust methods behave differently under various settings. However
especially with respect to the temporal models clear advantages can be observed
in the model based simulations when we make use of the additional information
presented by repeated measurements.

Overall four simulation studies have been conducted. The study in Section 
\ref{sec:results_predictions} aimed at explaining differences between robust 
and non\hyp{}robust domain predictions in scenarios with correlated random 
effects and area level outliers. The effect of area level outliers on the 
non\hyp{}robust methods is that variance paramters of the random effects are 
estimated too high. This has the price of efficiency as the non\hyp{}robust 
predictions are closer to the direct estimator. With this regard the robust
counterparts show good properties overall. The bias correction in this setting 
appears to have a positiv effect on the MSPE in that this quantity is smaller 
for outlying domains. This is due to the fact that the bias for outlying domains
is indeed reduced. However the results also indicate that its own tuning
parameter needs to be chosen with care in practical applications. In some
simulation scenarios the setting has been too conservative and showed a
negative effect on the overall domain predictions.

The study in Section \ref{sec:results_mse} provides insights on the performance
of the MSPE estimators; the pseudolinear based approach and the parametric
bootstrap. Both methods provide good results for the robust predictions with two
limitations: First, the parametric bootstrap fails at approximating the MSPE for
outlying domains. Second, the pseudolinearisation based approach can capture
this behaviour; however it depends on the relation between sampling variance and
actual MSPE of a domain. This is especially problematic with respect to the bias
correction.

Then in a next step the model of simulation is changed in Section
\ref{sec:results_unit}: instead of generating data on the area level we begin
from a unit level population model. This has the advantage that we can take
different direct estimators into account as well as the variance estimation for 
the direct estimator. However only the case of the *standard* FH model is
considered. Here a robust direct method and a generalised variance
function (GVF) have been utilised. We can see that it is important to use
the direct estimator with the smallest variance. The use of robust direct 
estimators did not show any improvement when such estimates are used in an area 
level model; even in the presence of unit level outliers. Furthermore the use of
a GVF may prove to be problematic in the presence of unit level outliers. This
topic is commented on again below as the results cannot be ragarded to be
conclusive but are a first assessment of the issue.

In a design based simulation study presented in Chapter
\ref{chap:results_design_based} the performance of the non\hyp{}robust and
robust FH model are compared in a more realistic setting. The target is the
tax\hyp{}turnover in 20 industry sectors in the Netherlands. The basis of this
analysis is a synthetic population based on the Structural Business Survey which
is provided by Statistics Netherlands. Here we have the combination of unit and
area level outliers in combination with an informative sampling design. The
study shows an overall improvement by using area level models. The robust domain
prediction yields an additional advantage in terms of MSPE; however the bias
corrected robust prediction appears to be less beneficial. Also the MSPE
estimators have been investigated: both methods, the parametric bootstrap as
well as the pseudolinearisation based approach, are problematic. A potential
reason is that we are in an application in which the variance parameter of the
FH model is estimated to be close to zero; which both methods cannot handle.


# Remarks and Open Research Questions

In a final step of discussing the results of this Thesis I want to present three
claims. These themselfs are ambitious but show the benefits and current
limitations of the results overall:

1. We should favor a robust method for small area predictions.
2. Unit level outliers may or may not be present in the sample; however with
area level information the issue cannot be tackled.
3. Favor an established design unbiased direct estimator when there is a choice.

Taking the results of the various model based simulation studies we may be
tempted to conclude that we should always use robust estimation methodology. In
this context results often suggest a clear advantage of robust methods when
outliers are present. On the other hand they are never superior but may be
considered equivalent when there are no outliers. This can be seen in Section 
\ref{sec:results_predictions} and \ref{sec:results_unit} as well as in Chapter 
\ref{chap:results_design_based}. A certain degree of deviation from the normal 
distribution may be assumed to be the rule and not an exception in *real world*
applications and here robust methods may present to be useful.

However an essential point is that practical issues like measuring the overall 
Goodness of Fit and variable selection have not been investigated yet. Hence in 
order to make the use of such methods reliable further research is needed. A 
further limiting point is the estimation of the MSPE. The parameteric bootstrap 
and pseudolinearisation based approach have proved to be useful in the model 
based simulation; however in the design based study we saw the limitation of 
these methods when the variance parameter of the FH model is estimated to be 
close to zero. At this point it remains unclear how an established method like
the MSPE estimator of @Pra90 performs in this setting. A more thorough
investigation may be needed. In addition it may be useful to carefully
investigate the possibility of utilising recent bootstrap methods of @Jio14 and
@Mok13. The main problem here may be the incorporation of correlated random
effects.

With respect to unit level outliers the discussion on the area level is complex
and the following is mostly based on the results of Section
\ref{sec:results_unit}. When it is plausible to assume unbiased direct estimates
as it is under the FH model it may be irrelevant if unit level outliers are
considered to be asymmetric or not; on the area level this effect does not exist
anymore. In such a case the FH model already is *robust* against unit level 
outliers since such observations are simply an additional source of
heterogeneity and drive the sampling variances. Domains with large sampling
variances are weighted down already by the standard FH model. Considerable
improvement for such domains can be expected independent of robust estimation
techniques.

The effect of unit level outliers may be amplified when we consider the use of 
generalised variance functions. The estimated sampling variances of the 
domains containing outlying units may be framed as outlying with respect to the 
GVF. This topic is discussed in Section \ref{sec:results_unit} but this claim 
needs more support and investigation than presented in this Thesis. The main 
problem is that the simulation conducted in Section \ref{sec:results_unit} may 
not present a case in which we make a *fair* comparisson since a significant
benefit of the considered GVF cannot be observed.

While conducting the model based simulation study of Section 
\ref{sec:results_unit} and the design based study in Chapter 
\ref{chap:results_design_based} several robust direct estimators have been applied. The 
main problems of using such methods are -- especially in the context of *small*
domains -- that these estimators introduce a higher variance for 
domains which do not contain outliers. Furthermore we not only need a good 
direct estimator but also for its variance. In this regard the sample mean and 
the HT estimator showed to provide more reliable results. The problem unit level
outliers in the context of a informative sampling design -- informative with 
respect to the target quantitiy -- may even be solved, since the inclusion 
probabilities provide sufficient information with respect to account for the 
variability in the data. Open for discussion may be the use of a robust method
combined with a GVF; however with this respect the issues above should be
adressed first.

# Theory

Chapter (?) reviewed the main advances in the SAE field with respect to two
developments: First the extension of the FH model by incorporating spatial and
temporal correlation structures into the random effects part of the model.
Second by reviewing the current state of robust estimation methodology within
the field. Here the presentation focused on the results for the robust
estimation of model parameters when we consider models framed as linear mixed
models.

In particular the spatial extension of the FH model was reviewed which was used
by @Pra08. Here the random effects part of the model is assumed to follow a
simultaneous autoregressive process (SAR) of order one. Under this model @Pra08
derived a spatial EBLUP (SEBLUP) which they applied on the survey on Life 
Conditions in Tuscany, Italy. They aimed at predicting the mean per capita 
income within municipalities. Furthermore they found that incorporating the
unobserved spatial correlation between domains -- the SAR process -- into the
prediction lead to an improvement in terms of MSPE; here however measured in
terms of the domain specific coefficient of variation.

The reviewed temporal extension by @Rao94 follows the idea to split the random 
effects into a random intercept and autocorrelated process (AR) of order one. 
The underlying data now has repeated measurements for each domain. The variation
within domains and hence between the repeated measurements is addressed using the
AR(1) process; the between domain variation is captured by having an additional 
random intercept. In this context they introduced a temporal EBLUP (TEBLUP).
Empirical results are here based on a model based simulation study. Later Sin05
showed the advantage of incorporating temporal autocorrelation into the analysis
where they predict the per capita consumption expenditure using an annual
consumer survey in India.

The methods used by @Sin05 do not rely on the AR process but use a Kalman filter
to take advantage of the temporal correlation structure instead. @Mar13 combined
the results by @Pra08 and @Rao94; they replaced the random intercept in the 
temporal model of @Rao94 with a SAR(1) process. Using this model they derive an 
spatio\hyp{}temporal EBLUP (STEBLUP). They evaluate their method using the 
Survey on Income and Living Conditions for Spain and predict two poverty
indicators. They show results for the spatial, temporal, and their
spatio-temporal extension to the FH model. Their results suggest that especially
the incorporation of the correlation over time presents a beneficial effect.

Next to the different possibilities to incorporate correlated random effects
Section (?) reviewed recent advances for outlier robust predictions in the SAE
field. The robust methodology used in this Thesis are based on the results of
@Sin09 and @Ric95. Here the idea is to *robustify* the score functions of the
maximum likelihood function for a given mixed linear model. Based on these
robust estimation equations the model parameters and domain predictions can be
derived. To this extend the residuals in the score function are bounded using an
appropriate influence function. In various model and design based simulation
studies the advantage of such methods have been demonstrated when outliers are
present in the data; see for example @Sin09, @Cha14, @Sch14, and @Sch16.

The main contribution of this Thesis is now the combination of the robust 
estimation methodology with the spatial and temporal extensions to the FH model.
This connection is established in Chapter \ref{chap:rfh}. Here I distinguished
between three types of outlying observations: unit level outliers, area level
outliers, and overly influential observations. The first two types are common in
the robust literature and describe outlying units and outlying areas
respectively. The third type may be artificial in the context of area level
models: they may present a problem when we smooth direct variance estimators. By
doing this we may create observations which appear to be reliable but are in
fact heavily influenced by unit level outliers. Especially with respect to area
level outliers and overly influential observations the a robust extension to the
FH model may present itself to be beneficial.

With regard to robust area level models four models have been under
consideration. The *standard* FH model, the spatial extension by @Pra08, the
temporal extension by @Rao94, and the combination in the spatio\hyp{}temporal
model by @Mar13. The result are here an area level robust EBLUP (REBLUP) which
essentially has already been introduced by @Sin09; a area level spatial REBLUP 
(SREBLUP) which to contrast it from @Sch11 is based on the FH model instead of 
the BHF model; the temporal REBLUP (TREBLUP); and the spatio\hyp{}temporal 
REBLUP (STREBLUP). Essentially these models are presented in a comprehensive
framework for robust area level models where some additional changes have been
made in contrast to the results by @Sin09:

- The robust score function have been changed such that they can be used in the
context of correlated random effects.
- The robust score functions have been combined with the results by @Cha11 and
@Cha14 to derive the area level REBLUPs -- the area level SREBLUP, TREBLUP, and
STREBLUP -- in a pseudo linear form. The results are presented in a general form
to include the general class of mixed linear models.
- This pseudolinear representation has lead to an IRWLS algorithm for the 
regression coefficients. Furthermore an algorithm for the optimisation of the 
random effects has been proposed which is also derived from the pseudolinear
form. Both solutions may have the advantage that they reduce to the non robust
BLUE estimator and EBLUP for the random effects when the influence function is
the identity.
- Solutions for the variance parameters of the different models are sought for
using a fixed point algorithm based on the results by @Chat12. The solutions for
these parameters need to be tuned for each model.
- Furthermore a simple bias correction for the robust prediction has been 
adapted based on the results of @Efr72. This bias correction is simply the
*limeted translation estimator* proposed by @Efr72 and may be useful when we
suspect asymmetric outliers.
- And finally the approach by @Cha11 to the estimation of the MSPE of domain
predictions has been extended to be used with the robust area level models with
correlated random effects. In this regard also the parametric bootstrap method
for the MSPE estimation by @Sin09 has been adapted although hardly any changes
have been necessary in this case.

These results may not only be useful for the specific models under consideration
but present a generic framework for robust area level models which are based on
the class of linear mixed models. The results may also be of interest outside
the SAE field for the robust estimation of linear mixed models with correlated
random effects.



# Implementation

Two results of this Thesis are also the software implementations in the 
`R`\hyp{}language \citep{R}. `saeRobust` \citep{War16} provides an
implementation of the area level REBLUP, SREBLUP, TREBLUP, and STREBLUP.
Additionally to the predictions for each model three types of diagnostic plots
are provided: normal Quantile\hyp{}Quantile plots for the random effects and
model residuals; mean\hyp{}difference plots for the predictions; and diagnostic
plots for the estimated MSPE. Additionally predictions can be made using the
proposed bias correction and for both versions of predictions the
pseudolinearisation based MSPE estimator and the parametric bootstrap are
implemented.

Chapter \ref{chap:saeRobust} reviews the main features of this software
implementation. In addition the stability of the algorithms is investigated. To
this extend a model based simulation study is conducted where the data is
generated to represent a numerically challenging situation. This is accomplished
by inducing deterministic outliers of relatively large magnitude and by using bad
starting values.

In principle the results of the stability tests are promising as in both
scenarios acceptable solutions can be found when we set the number of iterations
to a higher value. *Acceptable* here refers to a value close to zero at the
solution for the respective estimation equation. This however presents a trade 
off between the number of iterations, stability, and computational demand, which
can become relevant quickly with temporal data. The key to computationally less 
demanding solutions are the choice of starting values or generally an algorithm
which proves to have a higher convergence rate.

In addition to the package `saeRobust` also a software package for implementing 
model and design based simulation studies in the context of the SAE field is 
provided: `saeSim` \citep{War15}. This package has already been introduced in
@War16a and Chapter \ref{chap:saeSim} is an adaptation of this article to
  present this package within the context of this Thesis.

The main *design* aspect making `saeSim` a useful tool is that simulations can 
be composed by combining different components. Furthermore it may promote a 
reasonable way for the definition of such components within the `R`-language: as
short, single argument functions which take a `data.frame` as input and return 
it modified. In this regard the main aim of the package to propose a reasonable
way of conducting simulation studies in the `R`-language. This may contributing
towards the reproducibility and of such results within the field since source
code is easier to share and tools are tested to be correct.


# Results

Empirical results can be found in model based simulations in Chapter 
\ref{chap:results_model_based} and a design based simulation study in Chapter 
\ref{chap:results_design_based}. The aim of the model based simulation studies
has not been to investigate the beneficial effect of correlated random effects
on domain predictions. Instead these studies show how the robust and
non\hyp{}robust methods behave differently under various settings. However
especially with respect to the temporal models clear advantages have been
observed when we make use of the additional information presented by repeated
measurements.

Since the results are diverse I want to discuss them with respect to the three
statements below:

1. We should favor a robust method for small area predictions.
2. Unit level outliers may or may not be present in the sample; however with
area level information the issue cannot be tackled.
3. Favor an established design unbiased direct estimator when there is a choice.

Taking the results of various model based simulation studies we may be tempted 
to conclude that we should always use robust estimation methodology. In this 
context results often suggest a clear advantage of robust methods when outliers 
are present. On the other hand they are never superior but may be considered 
equivalent when there are no outliers. This can be seen in Section
\ref{sec:results_predictions} and \ref{sec:results_unit} as well as in Chapter
\ref{chap:results_design_based}. A certain degree of deviation from the normal
distribution should be assumed to be the rule and not an exception in *real
world* applications and here robust methods may present to be useful.

However an essential point is that practical issues like measuring the overall 
Goodness of Fit and variable selection have not been investigated yet. Hence in 
order to make the use of such methods reliable further research is needed. A 
further limiting point is the estimation of the MSPE. The parameteric bootstrap 
and pseudolinearisation based approach have prooved to be useful in the model 
based simulation; however in the design based study we saw the limitation of 
these methods when the variance parameter of the FH model is estimated to be 
close to zero. At this point it remains unclear how an established method like
the MSPE estimator of @Pra90 performs in this setting.

With respect to unit level outliers the discussion on the area level is complex
and the following discussion is mostly based on the results of Section
\ref{sec:results_unit}. When it is plausible to assume unbiased direct estimates
as it is under the FH model it may be irrelevant if unit level outliers are
considered to be asymmetric or not; on the area level this effect does not exist
anymore. In such a case the FH model already is *robust* against unit level
outliers since such observations are simply a source of heterogeneity and drive
the sampling variances. Domains with large sampling variances are weighted down
already by the standard FH model. Considerable improvement for such domains can
be expected independent of robust estimation techniques. 

The effect of unit level outliers may be amplified when we consider the use of 
generalised variance functions (GVF). The estimated sampling variances of the 
domains containing outlying units may be framed as outlying with respect to the 
GVF. This topic is discussed in Section \ref{sec:results_unit} but this claim 
needs more support and investigation than presented in this Thesis. The main 
problem is that the simulation conducted in Section \ref{sec:results_unit} may 
not present a case in which we make an *unfair* comparisson since a significant
benefit of the considered GVF cannot be observed.

The last point I want to mention is the case when we have asymmetric unit level
contamination which leads to a biased direct estimation. This can be the case
when we favor a direct estimator in which we ignore the sampling design. It can
also be the case when we draw samples with simple random sampling with unit
level contamination ...

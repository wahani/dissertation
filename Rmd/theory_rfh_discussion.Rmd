# Discussion
\label{sec:rfh_discussion}

This Section gives a short overview of the main findings of this Chapter.
Furthermore I will outline how the work is continued. The main findings and
contributions are:

- Extensions to the approach by @Sin09 for the estimation of robust mixed linear
models in the SAE field. This approach has been extended, for area level models
with correlated random effects.
- These findings have been combined with the results by @Cha11 and @Cha14 to
derive the area level REBLUPs -- the area level SREBLUP, TREBLUP, and STREBLUP
-- in a pseudo linear form. The results are presented in a general form to
include the general class of mixed linear models.
- This pseudo linear representation has lead to algorithms to find solutions for
the robust estimation equations. An IRWLS algorithm for $\pmat\beta$ has been
derived as well as a fixed point algorithm for the random effects, $\mat{u}$.
- Furthermore a simple bias correction for the robust prediction has been
adapted based on the results of @Efr72.
- And finally the approach by @Cha11 to the estimation of the MSPE of domain
predictions has been extended to be used with the robust area level models with
correlated random effects. In this regard also the parameteric bootstrap method
for the MSPE estimation by @Sin09 has been adapted although hardly any changes
have been necessary in this case.

The various methods and extensions are now further investigated in two ways.
First, we will see how the robust predictors are implemented inside a software
package in the `R`-language \citep{R}: `saeRobust` \citep{War16}. With respect
to this implementation especially the stability of results are of interest --
  see Chapter \ref{chap:saeRobust}. Second, these methods are used in model based
-- Chapter \ref{chap:results_model_based} -- and design based -- Chapter
\ref{chap:results_design_based} -- simulation studies. These simulations aim at
exploring the statistical properties of the robust predictions compared to their
non-robust counterparts. These simulation studies are conducted using the
`R`-language and a simulation framework developed alongside this Thesis. This
framework is implemented in the `R`-package `saeSim` \citep{War15} and some
discussion of this implementation is provided in Chapter \ref{chap:saeSim}.

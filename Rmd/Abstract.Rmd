The demand for reliable small area statistics from sample surveys has grown
substantially over the past decades due to their growing use in public and
private sectors. The field of Small Area Estimation aims at producing such
statistics. In this Thesis I consider several spatial and temporal extensions to
the Fay-Herriot (FH) Model to improve the mean squared prediction error (MSPE) of
predictions for small domains. Such predictions can be influenced by single
observations in the data; hence the estimation of the model parameters and
predictions is based on the estimation methodology around robust empirical best
linear unbiased prdictions (REBLUPs).

With regard to robust area level models four such models are under 
consideration: the FH model \citep{Fay79}, the spatial extension by @Pra08, the
temporal extension by @Rao94, and the spatio\hyp{}temporal model by @Mar13.
These methods are extended to obtain (i) an area level robust EBLUP (REBLUP)
which is the direct result of applying the results of @Sin09; (ii) an area level
spatial REBLUP (SREBLUP); (iii) a temporal REBLUP (TREBLUP); and (iv) a 
spatio\hyp{}temporal REBLUP (STREBLUP). I present these methods in a 
comprehensive framework of robust area level models. For the estimation of the 
MSPE I adapt the parametric bootstrap method from \textcite{Sin09} as well as 
the analytical solution based on a pseudolinear form of @Cha11. In this context 
also a bias correction based on the *limited translation estimator* of @Efr72 is
adapted to account for a potential bias associated to robust methods.

In addition to the development of these robust methods their implementation in 
the `R`\hyp{}package `saeRobust` \citep{War16} is investigated. The package 
provides an initial version for the application of the developed methodology. In
this regard some numerical stability tests are performed and also basic features
like diagnostic plots for model residuals are reviewed. Also an outcome of this 
Thesis is the package `saeSim` \citep{War15} which provides a framework for 
simulation studies within the `R`\hyp{}language. It aims at simplifying the 
configuration of such studies by providing tools for data generation, sampling, 
and a link to the parallel computing fascilities in the `R`\hyp{}language.

The methods under consideration are then further investigated in model and
design based simulation studies. Here the performance of the predictions and the
MSPE estimators are studied when area level outliers are present. Furthermore I
discuss how unit level outliers as well as area level outliers may effect domain
predictions based on area level models. This discussion is continued in the
context of a design based simulation. In this study a synthetic population is
utilised based on the Structural Business Survey in the Netherlands. Here the
tax\hyp{}turnover in 20 industry sectors is targeted. This data includes unit
level outliers, area level outliers, as well as an informative sampling design.

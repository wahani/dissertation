# Bias Correction

The two existing methodologies which are available to do bias correction for
robust models in SAE are not easily adapted to the general context of the
discussed area level models. Both approaches are based on a robust scale
estimate of the residuals within in a domain. In the standard RFH and SRFH there
is only one observation per domain, such that these estimates can not be
directly transfered.

However, the general problem remains. In the setting of the robustified score
functions and a misspecified distribution in the sense that outlying
observations have a different mean, the model can introduce a severe bias to
those outlying estimations.

Independet of this question @Fay79 refer to @Efr71 and @Efr72 who argue that the
Bayes Estimator and and the Emperical Bayes Estimator may improve the overall
prediction performance but can be ill suited for specific domains. In essence
this describes also the situation with the RFH models which introduce a bias to
the prediction of outlying domains.

Efron and Morris also suggest a simple correction to the prediction which can be
directly applied to the robust models under study. They suggest to restrict the 
prediction by an interval around the direct estimator. The width of this 
intervall can be constructed as a multiple of the known standard errors under
the model:

$$
\theta^{BC}_i = 
  \begin{cases}
    \tilde{y}_i - c & \text{if } \theta^{RFH}_i < \tilde{y}_i - c  \\
    \theta^{RFH}_i & \text{if } \tilde{y}_i - c \leq \theta^{RFH}_i \leq \tilde{y}_i + c \\
    \tilde{y}_i + c & \text{if } \theta^{RFH}_i > \tilde{y}_i + c \\
  \end{cases}
$$

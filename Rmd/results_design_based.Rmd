# Outline

In this final chapter I want to present a design based simulation study in which
the robust and non\hyp{}robust predictions under the FH model are compared. In
contrast to the model based simulations of Chapter
\ref{chap:results_model_based} the following study is based on one synthetic
population. The data is generated and provided by Statistics Netherlands (CBS)
and based on the Structural Business Survey (SBS). The target domains are here
industry sectors and the target statistic is the anual tax\hyp{}turnover within
domains. Using this data we can study several effects on the domain predictions
in a more realisitc setting. In particular in this study we combine the effect
of outlying units and domains in combination with a sampling design.

More details on the data and aim of the study from a contextual point of view 
are given in Section \ref{sec:results_design_data}. The sampling design and 
setup for the simulation as well as details on the used methods can be found in 
Section \ref{sec:results_design_scenario}. The results are then given in Section
\ref{sec:results_design_results} and a discussion of the results in a broader
context is provided in Section \ref{sec:results_design_discussion}.

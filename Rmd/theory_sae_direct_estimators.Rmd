# Direct Estimators
\label{sec:theory_sae_direct}

In this section I introduce a simple direct estimator and notation which 
is then used throughout the thesis. The estimator is of interest as it will be
used in the simulation studies in Part \ref{part:results}. @Leh09 give a more 
comprehesive overview of direct estimators and design based methods.

Let a population be denoted by $U$, consisting of $N$ units, which can be devided
into $D$ distinct domains or areas $U_1 \cup \dots \cup U_D$. Each area is of
size $N_i$, with $i = 1, \dots, D$ denoting area $i$, such that $N = \sum_{i =
  1}^D N_i$. $S$ denotes a sample from $U$ which in turn can be devided into $S_1
\cup \dots \cup S_D$, where $n$ is the sample size of $S$ and $n_i$ of $S_i$
  such that $n = \sum_{i = 1}^D n_i$.

Let $\mat{y}$ define the characteristic of interest and $y_{ij}$ the response value 
for unit $j$ with $j = 1, \dots, N_i$ in area $i$. Furthermore let the target 
quantity be the population mean in area $U_i$ defined by $\theta_i = \bar{Y}_i =
\frac{1}{N_i}\sum_{j = 1}^{N_i} y_{ij}$ . Note that the target quantity is not
necessarily a mean but can be any statistic in the population.

Given that the sample is drawn with simple random sampling without replacement
(SRSWOR), a design unbiased estimator is given by

\empty{
\begin{align}
\bar{y}_i = \frac{1}{n_i}\sum_{j = 1}^{n_i} y_{ij}\label{eq:sampleMean}
\end{align}
}with its design variance $\Exp{V}(\bar{y}_i|n_i) = (S_i^2 / n_i) \Paran{1 - n_i 
/ N_i}$ where $S_i^2 = 1 / (N_i - 1) \sum_{j = 1}^{N_i} \Paran{y_{ij} - 
\bar{Y}_i}^2$. To estimate the sampling variance, $S^2_i$ can be replaced by 
$s_i^2$ being an estimator using the sampled data, i.e. $s_i^2 = 1 / (n_i - 1) 
\sum_{j = 1}^{n_i} \Paran{y_{ij} - \bar{y}_i}^2$. Note that $n_i$ is random
under SRSWOR such that specific areas can have very few or even no sampled
units.

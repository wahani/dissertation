# The Problem of Outlying Observations for Area-Level Models

This section provides some motivation for the study of robust area-level models.
It mainly lays out under which scenarios a robust estimation may proove to be
beneficial and how these points are addressed in later chapters. Most importantly
you can find insights on what outlying observations are from an area-level
perspective. And if such data points exist, what is the source of this abnormal
behaviour?

In the following I want to distinguish between three types of outlying 
observations. Unit-level outliers and how they may effect the area-level 
analysis are discussed in \ref{sec:unit-level-outliers}. Area-level outliers can
be described as outlying domains, which means that an entire domain - or all 
units in that domain - behaves differently than all others and are further 
discussed in section \ref{sec:area-level-outliers}. A third kind can be best 
described as overly influential observations. The effect of such observations on
the area-level is more subtle. A first intuition and possible sources of this
type is given in section \ref{sec:overly-influencial-observations}.

## Unit-Level Outliers
\label{sec:unit-level-outliers}

Unit-level outliers can be representative or non-representative values but in
most cases it is beyond our reach to judge which kind they are because we only
see aggregates. They will influence the direct estimator in that this quntity
may have unexpected high or low values. But they also influence the estimation
of the standard error of the direct estimator which in turn can be used as the
true or rather given variance parameters in a Fay-Herriot type model.

In the situation where the direct variance estimators are used, two conflicting
effects need to be considered. First, we use an obviously unreliable estimator
for the sampling error and assume that such values can be used as the *true* 
variance parameters in the Fay-Herriot model. Such estimators will have poor 
properties when the target is the *true* sampling error especially in the 
context of outliers. This problem stimulates the recent discussion around 
smoothing the variance estimates prior to using them in a Fay-Herriot model (see
? for reference of this discussion and section 
\ref{sec:overly-influencial-observations} for how the robust estimator relates 
to this discussion).

Second, we may consider the direct variance estimators not as an informative
quantity for the *true* sampling error, but as informative about the unit-level
sample. This is an important aspect because the variance becomes a reliablility
index. The estimated sampling variance is large if outliers are present or in
general the sample is heterogenous; and it is low for areas in which we have a 
reliable direct estimator. In this case the direct variance estimation will 
weight down unreliable direct estimators, which is why the Fay-Herriot model can
be considered to be robust against unit-level outliers.

When we consider unit-level outliers it is relevant to ask why we would not use 
a robust direct estimator. From a practical point of view we may only have
access to non-robust estimators. On the other hand it may be crucial feedback to
a data provider to instead report robust estimates, e.g. a robust mean or 
median. Also it is unclear how this relates to the *self-adjusting* effect of 
the Fay-Herriot model. This aspect is addressed by model-based simulations in
section (?).


## Area-Level Outliers
\label{sec:area-level-outliers}

Area-level outliers are domains or areas which are far away from the bulk of the
observations. The source of such observations are not single units influencing
the direct estimator, but the fact that there exist domains which are
substantially different from the majority.

If we take the standpoint of a mixed-model perspective this means that there are
outliers in the random effect. From a model perspective where we treat the
random effect as i.i.d. random variable following a normal distribution such
values may arise by chance alone. This would mean that in truth the distribution
is indeed normal but we are in one of those rare cases in which we observe
abnormal behaviour of single domains. 

This argumentation seems to be unrealistic because under repeated sampling we
would expect the same domains to be abnormal which stimulates a more fundamental
discussion of mixed-models in Small Area Estimation (see ?); and it gives reason
to frame a random effect as fixed but unknown quntity which is approximated by a
normal distribution. In this setting the existance of outliers means that the 
normal distribution may well be a good approximation for the majority of areas 
but not for all them. This will raise the question if a different distribution
should be used to approximate the random effect, e.g. a mixture distribution of
normals or a scewed distribution.

Regardless of the perspective, in the application in which such values are 
observed a robust estimation technique can be beneficial. The main effect of a 
misspecified distributional assumption is that the variance parameter of the 
random effect will be overestimated - at least this is what we should expect in 
the presence of outliers. Also the parameter estimates of the fixed effects part
can be influenced by such observations, allthough it is unclear how they are
unfluenced specifically (under- or over-estimated).

Looking at the shrinkage estimator it can be derived how an overestimation of
the estimated variance parameter of the random effect influences area-level 
predictions. The larger the estimated variance compared to the area-specific 
sampling variance the stronger the prediction relies on the direct estimator.
However, the robust prediction will turn out not to be the shrinkage estimator
but instead a robustified best linear unbiased predictor for which the influence
is more subtle. The intuition of the effect, however, remains the same.


## The Creation of Overly Influencial Observations
\label{sec:overly-influencial-observations}

In this section I want to introduce a third kind of outlying observation. Such
values are better understood as overly influencial observations as they do not
necessarily are far away from the center of the data. Furthermore they can not
be understood by looking at the direct estimator alone but must be seen as pairs
of direct estimator and sampling variance. Together they determine the impact of
a single observation on the overall predictions.

To distinguish them from area- and unit-level outliers consider two hypothetical
scenarios from which these values can arise:

- There are no outliers present and the unit-level population model is that of 
(?). However, the sample sizes for most areas are very small - say between 5 and
50 - and only for very few domains we have sufficient sample size of say 500. 
This will inevitably result in a very heterogenous picture on the 
area-level where domains with sample size 500 will appear to be extremely 
reliable. The effect can be that such observations will dominate the global mean
and thus effectively become the value we are shrinking against.
- We have unit-level outliers influencing domain specific direct estimators. 
However, instead of using the estimated sampling variance we smooth the 
variances against a global parameter - essentially shrinking both means and 
variances as suggested in (?). This results in outlying domains for which, after
smoothing, the direct estimators appear to be more reliable than they truly are.
Effectively this reduces the self adjusting effect described in section 
\ref{sec:unit-level-outliers}.

Especially the second scenario should not be misunderstood as an argument
against smoothing, or that we should not care about unstable variance
estimation. Allthogh the variances are not directly smoothed the influence of
observations is bounded in a robust estimation procedure. In fact the introduced
robust area-level model can be considered to have a positive effect with respect
to both scenarios because single observations are restricted in their influence.
Furthermore the robust model may present an alternative to smoothing strategies,
although that has not been the initial intention, without the danger of creating
overly influencial observations.

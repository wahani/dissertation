This thesis introduces extensions to the Fay-Herriot Model, a frequentist
approach to Empirical Bayes estimators (i.e. James-Stein estimators) frequently
used in Small Area Estimation which is a sub-field within the field of
Statistics. In the three parts of this thesis I provide methodological
extensions to existing statistical models (\ref{part:theory} *Theory*),
considerations for implementing the findings as software
(\ref{part:implementation} *Implementation*) and results on numerical stability
as well as statistical properties of the introduced estimators as well as a
short case study (\ref{part:results} *Results*).

The thesis is seperated into three main parts. \ref{part:theory} *Theory*
introduces the underlying esimation methodology, i.e. linear mixed models, a
review of model based methods in Small Area Estimation as well as outlier robust
extensions within the field. Given these results extensions to existing
methodology is introduced in the form of a robustified Fay-Herriot estimator
with optional spatial and temporal correlated random effects. A special interest
lies in the concrete implementation of such (robust) estimators, and to meet
this focus several algorithms are proposed. (MSE, bias-correction)

\ref{part:implementation} *Implementation* introduces three main aspects: The 
verification that the implementation (in terms of software) is correct; How to 
evaluate the numerical accuracy and stability of the introduced algorithms; And 
which results to report to judge the quality of the numerical solution.

In \ref{part:results} *Results* the properties of the estimators are 
investigated in simulations and in the context of part 
\ref{part:implementation}. The numerical properties are devided into accuracy
and stability. Statistical properties are shown for the most reliable
implementations using model and design based simulation studies.

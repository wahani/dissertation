- Clement (2014): *Small Area Estimation with Application to Disease 
Mapping*
    - Desease mapping has specific metrics to measure deseases, like poverty
mapping has its own metrics for that.   
    - It is a review of SAE methods applied on that topic. Because the field 
is mostly concerned with counting the prevalence of deseases it is
concerned with poisson models and variations on such models, used with
EB and HB.
    - Some examples can be found.
- Lopez-Vicaino / et. al. (2015): *Small area estimation of labour force
indicators under a multinomial model with correlated time and area effects*
    - An application of small area estimation with a multinomial mixed
effects model. The random effect is modelled using a AR(1) process.
    - The study predictes unemplayment and employment rates for subgroups in
the Spanisch province Galicia.

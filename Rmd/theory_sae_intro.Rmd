# Overview

In the following I want to give a general overview of the field of small area 
estimation to the extent that it is possible to frame this thesis within the 
field. @Rao03 as well as @Rao15 give a comprehensive overview of established 
methods and research fields. @Gho94, @Rao99, @Pfe02 and @Pfe13 focus on the
status quo and main lines of discussion within the field at their given point in
time.

The problem small area estimation tries to solve, is to produce *reliable 
predictions* of a *target statistic* for *small domains*. A *target statistic* 
can be simple statistics such as means, counts or quantiles but can take any 
form, e.g. an inequality measure like the Gini coefficient for poverty mapping.
Such statistics are produced for *small domains*, where domain refers to
specific groups, e.g. sector of industry or groups defined by socio-economic
characteristics. Because of the frequent application to administrative data
domains are often defined by areas as a geographical unit. They are small in the
sense of few or no sampled units within these domains. This means that a direct
estimation, i.e. an estimation which only relies on the information available
within domains, is not reliable. *Reliability* is here measured by the variance
or mean squared error of the predictions.

Small area estimation tries to improve, often in terms of mean squared error, 
such domain predictions by borrowing strength from other domains. This can
happen by taking additional information from other data sources, like census and
register information, into account. Also structures in the data like spatial or 
temporal correlation can be exploited to improve a prediction.

The importance of the field can be explained by the increasing demand for
reliable estimates by policy makers and official statistics. Results are used
for fund allocation, health programs, agriculture or poverty mapping to name
only a few fields of application. Traditionally such estimates rely on survey
data but as the target domains become more diverse, reliable estimates are
connected to an increasing demand of sampled units within domains. The conflict 
between the demand of predictions for more diverse domains and the costs and 
feasibility for larger samples stimulates the progress within the field; as it 
is the promise to optimize the ratio between sampled units and the reliability
of estimates.

Commonly small area methods are divided into two streams, design and 
model based methods. Design based methods can be considered the traditional
methodology for analysing survey data and a comprehensive overview of these 
methods for SAE can be found in @Leh09. Design-based methods summarise different
direct and indirect techniques. The Horvitz\hyp{}Thompson (HT) estimator (@Hor52) 
which only uses sampled units within domains, and synthetic regression estimates
as well as model assisted methods like generalized regression (GREG)
estimators (@Saer92) are examples for such estimators. What these methods have
in common is that they incorporate information of the sampling design into the
estimation.

Conceptually design- and model-based methods differ in that design based
methods are used to optimally estimate a target parameter of a fixed and finite 
population. Model based methods instead rely on the idea that an observed
sample is drawn from a population which is but one possible realization of a 
*superpopulation* model, and it is the parameters of that superpopulation which 
are targeted. This difference leads to a trade-off when choosing between 
methods: Model-based methods can improve domain estimation in terms of variance 
even with small samples, however, they can not be considered design-unbiased. 
Design-based methods on the other hand are design-unbiased but have larger and 
possibly unacceptable high variances for small samples (see @Leh09).

Model-based methods can be seperated into area and unit level models.
Observations which can be associated to a specific domain are referred to as 
units. This can be companies within an industry sector or individuals within a 
municipality. The Area level describes models which use information such as 
direct estimates for domains and rely on area level information. A situation in
which these models are considered is when data can only be provided as
aggregates due to confidentiality.

One class of models in particular is favoured in different variations: Mixed 
Models. The Fay-Herriot (FH) model introduced by @Fay79 and the 
Battese\hyp{}Harter\hyp{}Fuller (BHF) model which was introduced by @Bat88 are 
the two basic models which are used for area and unit level models respectively.
Underlying is the idea to use auxiliary information in a regression to estimate 
a global conditional mean and add an extra component to capture the domain 
specific difference from that global mean. This general idea can be found in 
combination with different estimation methodologies, i.e. General Linear Mixed 
Models which are typically associated with best linear unbiased predictors 
(BLUPs), Empirical Bayes and Hierarchical Bayes. Although these different 
frameworks for estimation differ with respect to optimality criteria, 
equivalence of the different derived estimators can be shown for special cases. 
A more general discussion of mixed models in SAE can be found in @Jia06; @Rao03
and @Rao15 provide a comprohensive overview and comparisson of the different
frameworks.

A general property of model based methods is that a lot of their benefits in
terms of efficiency rely on strong distributional assumptions. Hence, not only
in the field of SAE have robust methods been exploited to reduce the negative
effect of a potential violation of these assumptions. The general problem here
is that single observations can have unwanted and overly large impact on results
and such observations are typically called outliers. @Cha86 uses the term
*representative* outliers to describe observations which are correctly recorded
and can not be ussumed to be unique. Nonrepresentative outliers, on the other
hand, may be best described as *not correctly recorded* and should be imputed or
generally delt with during the editing process of survey data.

To summarize robust methods in SAE I want distinguish between three different 
lines of discussion. First, if the distributional assumption - often a gaussian
distribution - appears to be implausible then it is only intuitive to replace
it. This often leads to the use of non-symmetric or heavy-tailed distributions
for the model error or random effect. Due to their flexibility often Baysian
modelling strategies are used in this context; see for example @Dat95 and
@Bel06. Secondly, methods are applied which are *naturally* more robust against
outlying observations. @Tza10 model instead of a conditional global mean a 
median - or more generally a quantile. The third approach is to remain with the 
original model or method and robustify the estimation equations. In this context
@Sin09 develop a robustified EBLUP, @Bea09 refer to a winzorization of the 
Horvitz-Thompson estimator and @Bea04 introduces a robust extension to
generalized regression estimation.

Given this background; in this thesis I introduce extensions to the Fay\hyp{}Herriot 
area level model using a model based perspective. More precisely an EBLUP based 
approach is taken to derive predictions with the possibility to model spatial 
and temporal covariance structures in the random effects. These models
are closely related to the results presented by @Mar13, who introduce spatial
and temporal extensions to the Fay-Herriot model. However, the methods in this
thesis are based on an estimation procedure which is robust against outliers
following the methodology introduced by @Sin09. Introduced extensions in the
literature around robust EBLUPs (REBLUPs) have been focused on unit-level
models, thus especially results to MSE estimation and Bias Correction are
extended for area-level models.

Besides contributing to the robust methodology of the field, several
contributions in terms of software are published alongside this dissertation.
@War15 introduces tools for simulation studies for the special case of small
area estimation and (?) implements the methods introduced in this thesis. All
results in this thesis rely on these two packages and a more detailed discussion
can be found in chapter (?).

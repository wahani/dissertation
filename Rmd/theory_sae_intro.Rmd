# Overview

In the following I want to give a general overview of the field of small area 
estimation to the extent that it is possible to frame this thesis within the 
field. @Rao03 as well as @Rao15 give a comprehensive overview of established 
methods and research fields. @Gho94, @Rao99, @Pfe02 and @Pfe13 focus on the
status quo and main lines of discussion within the field at their given point in
time.

The problem small area estimation tries to solve, is to produce *reliable 
predictions* of a *target statistic* for *small domains*. A *target statistic* 
can be simple statistics such as means, counts or quantiles but can take any 
form, e.g. an inequality measure like the Gini coefficient for poverty mapping.
Such statistics are produced for *small domains*, where domain refers to
specific groups, e.g. sector of industry or groups defined by socio-economic
characteristics. Because of the frequent application to administrative data
domains are often defined by areas as a geographical unit. They are small in the
sense of few or no sampled units within these domains. This means that a direct
estimation, i.e. an estimation which only relies on the information available
within domains, is not reliable. *Reliability* is here measured by the variance
or mean squared error of the predictions.

Small area estimation tries to improove, often in terms of mean squared error, 
such domain predictions by borrowing strength from other domains. This can
happen by taking additional information from other data sources, like census and
register information, into account. Also structures in the data like spatial or 
temporal correlation can be exploited to improve a prediction.

The importance of the field can be explained by the increasing demand for
reliable estimates by policy makers and official statistics. Results are used
for fund allocation, health programs, agriculture or poverty mapping to name
only a few fields of application. Traditionally such estimates rely on survey
data but as the target domains become more diverse, reliable estimates are
connected to an increasing demand of sampled units within domains. The conflict 
between the demand of predictions for more diverse domains and the costs and 
feasibility for larger samples stimulates the progress within the field; as it 
is the promise to optimize the ratio between sampled units and the reliability
of estimates.

Commonly small area methods are devided into two different streams, design- and 
model-based methods. Design-based methods can be considered the traditional 
methodology for analyzing survey data and a comprehensive overview of these 
methods for SAE can be found in @Leh09. Design-based methods summarise different
direct and indirect techniques. The Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator (@Hor52) 
which only uses sampled units within domains, and synthetic regression estimates
as well model-assisted methods like generelized regression (GREG) estimators
(@Saer92) are examples for such estimators. What these methods have in common is
that they incorporate information of the sampling design into the estimation.

Conceptually disgn- and model-based methods differ in that design-based methods 
are used to optimally estimate a target parameter of a fixed and finite 
population. Model-based methods instead rely on the idea that an observed sample
is drawn from a population which is but one possible realization of a 
super-population model, and it is the parameters of that super-population which 
are targeted. This difference leads to a trade-off when choosing between
methods: Model-based methods can improve domain estimation in terms of variance
even with small samples, however, they can not be considered design-unbiased.
Design-based methods on the other hand are design-unbiased but have larger and
possibly unacceptable high variances for small samples (see @Leh09).

Generally model-based methods are devided into area- and unit-level models.
Observations which can be ascociated to a specific domain are referred to as
units. This can be companies within an industry sector or individuals within a
muniscipality. The Area-level describes models which use information such as
direct estimates for domains and thus rely on area-level information. A
situation in which these models are considered is when data can only be provided
as aggregates due to confidentiatlity.

One class of models in particular is favored in different variations: Mixed
Models. I use a general term of mixed models here because it summarizes the
commonality accross the many variations in the fields. Underlying is the idea to
use auxiliary information in a regression to estimate a global conditional mean
and add an extra component to describe the domain specific difference from that
global mean. This general idea can be found in combination with different
estimation methodologies, i.e. General Linear Mixed Models which is typically
ascociated with restricted Maximum Likelihood, Empirical Bayes and Hirarchical
Bayes.

Although these different frameworks for estimation differ with respect to optimality criteria, e.g. MSE and squared error loss, equivalence of the different derived estimators can be shown for special cases. 

Extensions take into account different distributional assumptions about the response variable

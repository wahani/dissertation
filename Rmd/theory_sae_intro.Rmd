# Overview

In the following I want to give a general overview of the field of small area 
estimation to the extent that it is possible to frame this thesis within the 
field. @Rao03 as well as @Rao15 give a comprehensive overview of established 
methods and research fields. @Gho94, @Rao99, @Pfe02 and @Pfe13 focus on the
status quo and main lines of discussion within the field at their given point in
time.

The problem small area estimation tries to solve, is to produce *reliable 
predictions* of a *target statistic* for *small domains*. A *target statistic* 
can be simple statistics such as means, counts or quantiles but can take any 
form, e.g. an inequality measures like the Gini coefficient for poverty mapping.
Such statistics are produced for *small domains*, where domain refers to
specific groups, e.g. sector of industry or groups defined by socio-economic
characteristics. Because of the frequent application to administrative data
domains are often defined by areas as a geographical unit. They are small in the
sense of few or no sampled units within these domains. This means that a direct
estimation, i.e. an estimation which only relies on the information available
within domains, is not reliable. *Reliability* is here measured by the variance
or mean squared error of the predictions.

Small area estimation tries to improove, often in terms of mean squared error, 
such domain predictions by borrowing strength from other domains. This can
happen by taking additional information from other data sources, like census and
register information, into account. Also structures in the data like spatial or 
temporal correlation can be exploited to improve a prediction.

The importance of the field can be explained by the increasing demand for
reliable estimates by policy makers and official statistics. Results are used
for fund allocation, health programs, agriculture or poverty mapping to name
only a few fields of application. Traditionally such estimates rely on survey
data but as the target domains become more diverse, reliable estimates are
connected to an increasing demand of sampled units within domains. The conflict 
between the demand of predictions for more diverse domains and the costs and 
feasibility for larger samples stimulates the progress within the field; as it 
is the promise to optimize the ratio between sampled units and the reliability
of estimates.

Two very different approaches to statistical analysis are commonly considered to characterize different research streams. Design- and model-based methods. 




- Clement (2014): *Small Area Estimation with Application to Disease 
Mapping*
    - Desease mapping has specific metrics to measure deseases, like poverty
mapping has its own metrics for that.   
    - It is a review of SAE methods applied on that topic. Because the field 
is mostly concerned with counting the prevalence of deseases it is
concerned with poisson models and variations on such models, used with
EB and HB.
    - Some examples can be found.
- Lopez-Vicaino / et. al. (2015): *Small area estimation of labour force
indicators under a multinomial model with correlated time and area effects*
    - An application of small area estimation with a multinomial mixed
effects model. The random effect is modelled using a AR(1) process.
    - The study predictes unemplayment and employment rates for subgroups in
the Spanisch province Galicia.

# Overview

The underlying problem which small area estimation tries to solve, is to produce
*reliable predictions* of a *target statistic* for *small domains*. A *target
statistic* can be simple statistics such as means, counts or quantiles but can
take any form such as inequality measures like the Gini coefficient for poverty
mapping. Such statistics are produced for *small domains*, where domain can
define a veriety of different groups, e.g. sector of industry or groups defined 
by socio-economic characteristics. Because of the frequent application to 
administrative data domains are often defined by areas as a geographical unit.
They are small in the sense of few or no sampled units within these domains.
This means that a direct estimation, i.e. an estimation which only relies on the 
information available within domains, is not reliable. *Reliability* is here 
measured by the variance or mean squared error of the predictions.

Small area estimation tries to improove, often in terms of mean squared error, 
such domain estimates by borrowing strength from other domains. This can happen 
by taking additional information from other data sources, like census and
register information, into account. Also structures in the data like spatial or
temporal correlation can be exploited to improve a prediction.

Mapping*
    - Desease mapping has specific metrics to measure deseases, like poverty
mapping has its own metrics for that.   
    - It is a review of SAE methods applied on that topic. Because the field 
is mostly concerned with counting the prevalence of deseases it is
concerned with poisson models and variations on such models, used with
EB and HB.
    - Some examples can be found.

indicators under a multinomial model with correlated time and area effects*
    - An application of small area estimation with a multinomial mixed
effects model. The random effect is modelled using a AR(1) process.
    - The study predictes unemplayment and employment rates for subgroups in
the Spanisch province Galicia.

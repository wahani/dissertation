# Small Area Estimation Using Robust Extensions to Area Level Models

## Rebuilding the Results

To rebuild all results and document you need to go into the folder and run
`make`. You should have the following programs on your `PATH` variable or making
it available appropraite to your operating system:

- `make`
- `R` and `Rscript`
- Latex and `latexmk`
- `biber`
- `pandoc`

To set up the computational environment in `R`, you can go to
`./R/00Dependencies.R` to install all packages needed.


## Structure

  /R/
    00Dependencies.R              # install R dependencies
    stability.R                   # generates output for Section 4
    simAreaLevel.R                # generates output for Section 6.1
    simAreaLevelMSE.R             # generates output for Section 6.2
    simFromUnitToAreaLevel.R      # generates output for Section 6.3
    simCBS.R                      # generates output for Chapter 7
